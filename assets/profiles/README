This text file describes how to write down PRI -Auto profiling- specifications
for several CA. If you wants to modify any document for customizing it,read
below instruction very carefully.

- auto-profile-dataset.xls
    : This file specifies which ".xml" file should be loaded for the country 
      and the operator.

    * MODEL: specifies the model name. 
      This field will be matched at runtime with the value returned by
      SystemProperties.get("ro.product.model").
      The java regex can be used for describing a matching rule.
      You can keep this field undefined if the record is for all models. 
      In this case, you SHOULD fill this field as "undefined" or "-".

    * COUNTRY: specifies the region to be launched.
      This field will be matched at runtime with the value returned by
      SystemProperties.get("ro.build.target_country").
      The java regex can be used for describing a matching rule.
      You can keep this field undefined if the record is for all regions. 
      In this case, you SHOULD fill this field as "undefined" or "-".

    * OPERATOR: specifis the operator to be launched.
      This field will be matched at runtime with the value returned by
      SystemProperties.get("ro.build.target_operator").
      The java regex can be used for describing a matching rule.
      You can keep this field undefined if the record is for all regions. 
      In this case, you SHOULD fill this field as "undefined" or "-".

      * IF YOU KEEP THE COUNTRY UNDEFINED, THE OPERATOR COLUMN ALSO SHOULD 
	  BE UNDEFINED. *

    * RESOURCE NAME: specifies a file path to be loaded for configuring profile.
      This field is mendatory.
      The file path is case-sensetive.
      
    * RESOURCE MCC: specifies MCC code of the launching region.
      If the record is for a specific region, you can fill this column with
      the MCC code of the region.
      If you specify MCC code, IME application will ignore MCC code loaded from
      the real SIM card and will override MCC code the value which you specify.
      This operation is effective only for LGEIME application.
      MCC code is used to configure the default values of any items under "LG 
      keyboard setting" and to customize keyboard layouts for some specific 
      regions, such as Korea, China and North America.
      You SHOULD keep this field undefined if you want to configure different
      settings according to MCC code loaded from the real SIM card, such as 
      europe open CA, India open CA and ESA open CA.
      In this case, you SHOULD fill this field as "undefined" or "-".
      
    * RESOURCE MNC: specifies MNC code of the launching operator.
      If the record is for a specific operator, you can fill this column with
      the MCC code of the operator.
      If you specify MNC code, IME application will ignore MNC code loaded from
      the real SIM card and will override MNC code the value which you specify.
      This operation is effective only for LGEIME application.
      MNC code is used to configure the default values of any items under "LG
      keyboard setting" and to customize keyboard layouts for some specific
      operators, such as AT&T, Verizon, SKT, KT and U+.
      You SHOULD keep this field undefined if you want to configure different
      settings according to MNC code loaded from the real SIM card, such as
      europe open CA, India open CA and ESA open CA.
      In this case, you SHOULD fill this field as "undefined" or "-".
      
    * REGION CODE: specifies the symbol page.
      If the record is for a specific symbol page, you can fill this column with
      the REGION CODE. 
      Europe open, America, Latin america, China, Korea use particular symbol page.
      If your specify countries are in these region, you SHOULD fill this column.
      Others case, you SHOULD fill this field as "undefined" or "-".
	  
	  Current supported REGION CODE - Modle released region
	  CHINA				- 	Model released on China and use symbol table of China scenario.
	  HONGKONG			-	Model released on Hongkong and use symbol table of HK/TW scenario.
	  TAIWAN			-	Model released on Taiwan and use symbol table of HK/TW scenario.
	  KOREA				-	Model released on Korea and use symbol table of Korea scenario.
	  CIS				-	Model released on CIS and use symbol table of Europe scenario.
	  EUROPE			-	Model released on Europe and use symbol table of Europe scenario.
	  NORTH_AMERICA		-	Model released on America and use symbol table of America scenario.
	  SOUTH_AMERICA		-	Model released on America and use symbol table of America scenario.
	  AME				-	Model released on Africa & Middle East and use symbol table of Global scenario.
	  ESA				-	Model released on South & East Asia released on Africa & Middle East and use symbol table of Global scenario.
	  ESAME				-	Model released on AME & ESA and use symbol table of Global scenario.
	  ISRAEL			-	Model released on Israel and use symbol table of Global scenario.
      
- IME_setting_(MODEL)_(COUNTRY)_(OPERATOR).xml
    : This file specifies profile configuration for common or a specific
    operator.
    The file recommand to be named following below conventions.
    
      (MODEL)   : model name which you write down at "auto-profile-dataset.xls"
                If you didn't define it, this may be "DEFAULT"
      (COUNTRY) : country which you write down at "auto-profile-dataset.xls"
                If you didn't define it, this may be "DEFAULT"
      (OPERATOR): operator which you write down at "auto-profile-dataset.xls"
                If you didn't define it, this may be "DEFAULT"

                   Generation Rule
    ***************************************************
       1. XML must include one <commomprofile> item.

       2. If the value of item is same with that of
          <commonprofile> item, it don't need to be
          described.

       3. The name of country should never follow 
          the name of language, basically.

       4. CAUTION : *For some special cases*, the name 
          of country must follow the name of 
          language.

              A. en & QWERTZ ==> en_AU
              B. en & AZERTY ==> en_FR
              C. sr          ==> sr_RS
              D. fr & QWERTY ==> fr_CA
              E. fr & QWERTZ ==> fr_CH
              F. it & QWERTZ ==> it_CH
              G. nl & AZERTY ==> nl_BE
			  H. S Chinese   ==> zh_CN
			  I. T Chinese(HK)=> zh_HK
			  J. T Chinese(TW)=> zh_TW

             Or if you want to select more languages in addition to the default
             writing language by default, you can write down a comma-seperating
             list of languages like "en_AU,de,fr_CH".
             You can specify just one language, of course. -->
